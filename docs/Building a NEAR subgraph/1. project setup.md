### 1.1. Setup a new project for your subgraph

The first step is to set up a new NodeJs project, you can do the same steps below with `npm` too

```sh
$ yarn init
```

> If you want to use the hosted service by The Graph you need to set up a GitHub repo for the project too


### 1.2. Installing required packages

Once you have a project running, you need to install the Graph CLI and Graph types as devDependencies:

```sh
$ yarn add --dev @graphprotocol/graph-cli @graphprotocol/graph-ts
```

- [`graph-cli`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-cli): provide us with commands to build and deploy our subgraphs
- [`graph-ts`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-ts):  is a TypeScript/AssemblyScript library of subgraph specific types which we're going to use in our mapping files


### 1.3. Adding scripts to package.json

The main commands we're going to need are `graph codegen` and `graph build` and `graph deploy`. So to make it easier, let's add them to our scripts in package.json:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "codegen": "graph codegen",
    "build": "graph build",
    "deploy": "graph deploy curaOS/subgraph --node https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/ --ipfs https://api.thegraph.com/ipfs/"
  },
````

- `graph codegen`: Generates AssemblyScript types from the schema file into a /generated folder, which we're going to use in our mapping functions.
- `graph build`:  Generates wasm code from the mapping files and prepares all the subgraph files for deployment into a /build folder.
- `graph deploy`: Deploys the subgraph to the hosted service.
